## Allow me to present a brief overview of our project - the game "Labyrinth":

### To commence, one must initiate the main.py file. Upon launching the game, three options are available:

- Play
- Instructions
- Exit
  
## Instructions: 
This section contains a slightly modified set of game instructions derived from the website: https://zabawnik.org/wystarczy-kartka-i-dlugopis. Modifications include:
We have set the grid size to 35.
We have omitted the labels 'A to J' and '1 to 10' from the top and side margins of the board to enhance the interface's aesthetics.

Stage One of the Game unfolds as follows:
Upon pressing the ‘Play’ button, Player 1 draws the labyrinth.
After completing the drawing, the game transitions to the labyrinth drawing phase for Player 2.
Stage Two of the Game:

Player 1 begins by guessing the labyrinth created by Player 2.
When Player 1 clicks on a wall or discovers 5 grid squares, Player 2 takes their turn at guessing.
The labyrinth guessing process is dynamic for both players, automatically switching between them.

Determining the Winner:

The game concludes when either Player 1 or Player 2 finds the treasure.
Upon the game's conclusion, the winner is revealed.
