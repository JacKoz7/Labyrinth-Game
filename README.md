## Student Project Description - "Labyrinth" Game
### Upon starting the game, three options are available:
- Play
- Instructions ---> contain a slightly modified game guide from the website: https://zabawnik.org/wystarczy-kartka-i-dlugopis.
- Exit

### Modifications:

- We set the number of squares to 35.
- We removed the labels 'from A to J' and 'from 1 to 10' on the top and side margins of the board to improve the interface aesthetics.
### The first stage of the game is as follows:

- After pressing the 'Play' button ---> Player 1 draws the maze.
- Upon completing the drawing ---> Move on to drawing the maze for Player 2.
### The second stage of the game:

- Player 1 starts guessing the maze created by Player 2.
- When Player 1 clicks on a wall or finds 5 squares ---> Player 2 starts guessing.
The maze guessing process is dynamic for both players ---> it switches between them automatically.
Determining the winner:

### The game ends when Player 1 or Player 2 finds the treasure.
After the game ends, the winner is revealed.
